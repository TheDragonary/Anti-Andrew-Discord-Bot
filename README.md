# Anti-Andrew-Discord-Bot
 
The enemy of [Andrew Bot](https://github.com/SpookedDoor/Andrew-Discord-Bot)

In other words... not stupid. ~~(debatably)~~

This bot cooks every time Andrew bot says something absolutely moronic.

----------------------------

# BEFORE YOU USE THIS
This bot REQUIRES [Andrew Bot](https://github.com/SpookedDoor/Andrew-Discord-Bot). You can manually modify the code to make it respond to anybody, or a similar bot, but by default, you NEED to have Andrew in your server for this bot to work, as he only responds to Andrew as-is.

Well, now for the content warning; Like Andrew-Bot, this bot was made as an inside-joke and it can say some hella out of pocket offensive shit. Also, unlike Andrew, this is purely a LLM as of writing this, and it will probably stay that way.

Now, let's get started with the real shit, shall we?

# THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE EVEN LESSER GROUP OF THOSE WHO'LL NEED IT
## CLONING
As always, you'd have to clone the repo first, using:
```
git clone https://github.com/TheDragonary/Anti-Andrew-Discord-Bot.git
```
Or you could use Github Desktop! Doesn't matter, whatever gets the job done.

## THE DRAGON ON THE SLAYER ~~ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£~~

Because this bot requires Andrew-bot, I'll hope you already read the discord.js guide and everything. For the most part, the rest of this is MOSTLY copied from Andrew's version of this section, but there are a few cruical parts changed, since Anti-Andrew does NOT have the exact same file structure.

You're still required to install ``npm install discord.js openai dotenv`` in your terminal, though.

Afterwards, you WILL need to have an ``.env`` file and have it look like this:
```js
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOURTOKENHERE
// The Openrouter key is optional IF you're going to use the local AI method.
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=YOUR-OPENROUTERKEYHERE
```
And a ``config.json`` that looks something like this. 
```json
{
    "token": "YOURTOKENHERE",
    "clientId": "YOURCLIENTID"
}
```

As of now, Openrouter IS still supported for Anti-Andrew (not permanently, since it will soon mainly start to use local AI backends soon. Hell, I even use Anti with Kobold, but it's not yet the main method).

If you're doing the Openrouter method, make sure to set your ``baseURL`` in ``./events/messageCreate.js`` to look something like this:  
```dotenv
    baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```
And your model to be something like this:
```dotenv
const model = 'deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free';
```
Of course, you can change the model to be whatever you want, as long as it's on [Openrouter](https://openrouter.ai/models).

-----

### Local AI Method
But if you want to use the local AI method (which is better), you'll of course have to use a local AI backend such as [KoboldCPP](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp). 

Once you have KoboldCPP installed and set up, make sure to set your ``baseURL`` to be the same as it is in ``./events/messageCreate.js``. It should look something like this:  
```dotenv js
	baseURL: "http://localhost:5001/v1",
	apiKey: "0"
```

Then make sure the model is set to:
```js
const model = 'koboldcpp';
```

## Differences between the AI methods and which one you should choose
Well, of course there's both pros and cons to the methods you choose, and I wouldn't blame you for being confused on which to choose.

For instance, if your PC is lower end, I *would* recommend using Openrouter. But if your PC is more capable, then I'd recommend a local AI backend, like Kobold.

Now, let's start off with Openrouter's pros and cons.

## Openrouter
Pros:

-Decently fast, and easier on your PC, since you don't need to be running models directly on your PC.

-You can use most of the models on the site for Anti.

Cons:

-There is a daily limit on certain models, such as Deepseek V3, (which is actually why we're making the switch to local AIs).

-Sometimes the responses take a hell of a long time (for me it would sometimes take around 5 minutes, which also contributed to me switching).

-It ain't Kobold

-----

## KoboldCPP
While any local backend can be used of course, I'm gonna focus on Kobold since that's the only one I've used.

Now that we're done with Openrouter's pros and cons, it's time to see Kobold's. 

Pros:

-Much faster responses 

-No daily limit or anything of the sort

-You can download any model and run it locally

Cons:

-You need a good PC. Or at least a fairly decent one.

-----
## Overall
Regardless of which one you choose, the bot will work. Just the efficiency will vary.

If you choose to use Openrouter solely because of your PC or the convenience, that's very understandable. 

(Unfinished README. I'll continue this later, but for the most part all the important info is here lmao.)
